Flash Attention Quick Installation Commands
==========================================

Since you're in the nunchaku environment and have CUDA 12.8, try these commands in order:

1. SIMPLEST - One-line install with CUDA path:
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

2. If that fails, try with architecture specified:
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8 TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="9.0" pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

3. If compilation takes too long or fails, try limiting jobs:
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8 MAX_JOBS=4 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

4. Alternative - Install from conda-forge:
   conda install -c conda-forge flash-attn

5. If all else fails, install PyTorch's built-in optimized attention (not as fast but better than nothing):
   pip install torch>=2.0 --upgrade
   # Then in your code, PyTorch will use its optimized SDPA

After installation, verify with:
   python -c "import flash_attn; print(f'Flash Attention {flash_attn.__version__} installed!')"

Then run:
   python check_setup_status.py

You should see "✅ Flash Attention 3: INSTALLED & WORKING"
